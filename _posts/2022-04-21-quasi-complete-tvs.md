A topological vector space is considered quasi-complete if every subset that is closed and bounded is complete.

If $X$ is a normed space and $Y$ is a quasi-complete locally convex toplogical vector space then the set of all compact linear maps of $X$ into $Y$ is a closed vector subspace of $$ L_{b}(X;Y) $$
