# Motivation

The problem of classical mechanics is determining the position of a particle at any time $t$, typically denoted $x(t)$.

In quantum mechanics, we are looking for the **wave function** $\Psi(x,t)$ which plays an analogous role to Newton's second law and is obtained by solving

$$ \text{Schr√∂dinger's equation:} \ i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V\Psi$$

where $i$ denotes $\sqrt{-1}$, $\hbar$ is Planck's constant $h$ divided by $2\pi$ ($1.054573 \cdot 10^{-34}$) and $V$ is a potential energy function.

# What exactly is the wave function?

The main meaning of the wave function comes from **Born's statistical interpretation**, which states that $\vert \Psi(x,t) \vert^2$ gives the **probability** of finding the particle at point $x$ at time $t$. A bit more formally, $\int_a^b \vert \Psi(x,t) \vert^2 dx$ gives the probability of finding the particle between $a$ and $b$ at time $t$.

# Indeterminacy

One problem arises when defining the wave function like so: Where was the particle before measurement? Let's say the a particle's position was found to be at $C$. There are 2 plausible answers:
1. The particle was at $C$
2. The particle was not really anywhere

In 1964, an experiment by Bell confirmed that the particle was not really anywhere, which implies that measurement actually creates a specific result. It is agreed that a second measurement must return the same value, so we say the the wave function **collapses** upon to measurement to $C$.
